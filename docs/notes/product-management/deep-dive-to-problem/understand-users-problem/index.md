# Understand Users’ Problem

## How to Identify Problems?
As said in the previous chapter, the first step of product development is doing research to identify & define use’s problems. But, how to identify the problems? What should we search for? 

As start, you can focus on these 3 main focus :

### Who’s your target user?
Understand who will be using your product. Identify their characteristics, needs, and behaviors. Knowing your target user helps you tailor your product to their specific preferences and challenges.

### What’s happening now?
Analyze the current situation in the market and in the user’s experience. This includes looking at existing products, trends, and how users currently solve their problems. This step helps you see gaps or opportunities for improvement. You can also mention the existing solution done by the user.

### What problems that need to be solved?
Pinpoint the specific pain points and challenges your users face. These are the issues your product should address to provide real value. Understanding these problems clearly guides your product design and development decisions. Not only users’ problem, you can also find problem from the existing solution (existing solutions but have not been able to solve user problem

## Why we have to start from problems?

### Understanding users’ needs
The first step in developing any product is to identify the user's needs and pain points. Engaging directly with users through interviews and surveys helps to uncover the core issues they face, **ensuring that the development process is grounded in real-world needs** rather than assumptions or trends. This user-centric approach minimizes the risk of creating a product that fails to resonate with its intended audience.


### Validating idea
By starting with a clear understanding of the problem, teams can a**void wasting resources on solutions that do not address significant user needs.** This validation process often involves market research to assess competition and existing solutions, ensuring that the new product offers a unique value proposition.

### Competitive Adventage
Understanding user problems deeply can help **identify market gaps that competitors might miss.** By solving these unmet needs, a product can gain an edge and become a top choice for users. This approach not only helps in creating better products but also improves marketing by clearly showing how the product solves real issues.

### Iterative improvement 
Starting from problems **encourages an iterative development approach** where feedback loops are integral. As products are developed and released, ongoing user feedback can inform future iterations, helping teams refine their offerings based on actual usage and satisfaction levels

::: tip Summary
Beginning product development with a focus on problems ensures that products are user-centered, validated against real needs, competitive, and adaptable to feedback. This foundational approach significantly increases the likelihood of creating successful products that effectively solve user challenges.

## Data Validation 
Every solution developed in a product must come from a problem. We must ensure that the problems raised are urgent and need to be resolved immediately. For that, we need to conduct research as a form of validation of the problems experienced by users, whether the problem is really experienced by users. We need to collect data as evidence, whether many have experienced the problem, and whether the problem is really urgent so that it needs to be resolved. Product validation involves testing your idea with real people in your target market to ensure there's demand for what you want to create. There are several techniques for collecting data from users

### Primary data
Primary data is data obtained directly by researchers
Data sources: questionnaires, FGDs, interviews conducted directly by researchers

### Secondary data
Secondary data is data collected by a third party other than the researcher.
Data source: Journals, news, statistical data, questionnaires conducted by other researchers (maximum 5 years)
