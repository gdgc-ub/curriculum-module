# Introduction to Product Management

## What is Product Management?

Product Management is a role in a product development team that is responsible for managing the product development process, from doing research, defining problems to solve, initiating solutions, collaborating with the team & stakeholder, until the product is launched. They also do evaluation in the after-launched phase so the product can still sustain in the industry. In short, product management is the method of guiding a product from conception to market success. It demands a balance of strategic thinking, customer empathy, and cross-functional collaboration. 

Basically, Product Manager is the bridge between the business, User Experience (UX), and technology teams. A Product Manager should have expertise in one particular area and be willing to learn the other two, although it is not necessary to be an expert in all three.
