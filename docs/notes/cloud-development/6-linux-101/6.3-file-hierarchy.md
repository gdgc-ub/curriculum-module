# Linux File Hierarchy Structure

![img](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQGuHl_yMRdiQw/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1680372550971?e=1738195200&v=beta&t=5Jwc62HmmNNMFxBo7-QaWjQXLRFbi0Mz7G17TKoo0UU)

Imagine stepping into a well-organized library where every section has a specific purpose and books are categorized neatly and categorized. The Linux file hierarchy is much like this library, it’s a structured framework designed to help users and programs find and manage files efficiently. At its heart is the root directory (/), the origin point from which every file and directory branches out, forming a tree-like structure. Then inside the root directory, there are many subdirectories that we will cover right now.

To visualize it in a tree-like structure, you can run this command
```zsh
sudo apt-get install tree -y # install tree command
tree -L 1 /
```

In my fedora machine, it looks like this
```zsh
/ # I'm root :D
├── afs
├── bin -> usr/bin
├── boot
├── Desktop
├── dev
├── etc
├── home
├── lib -> usr/lib
├── lib64 -> usr/lib64
├── lost+found
├── media
├── mnt
├── opt
├── proc
├── root
├── run
├── sbin -> usr/sbin
├── snap -> /var/lib/snapd/snap
├── srv
├── sys
├── Templates
├── tmp
├── usr
└── var
```

Here we have table that describes the purpose, use of each directory and examples

| **Directory** | **Description**                                                                                     | **Examples**                           |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `/`           | The root directory. The starting point of the Linux file system.                                    | -                                      |

| `/var`        | Variable files that change frequently during system operation.                                       | `/var/log`, `/var/mail`, `/var/cache` |
| `/dev`        | Device files representing hardware.                                                                 | `/dev/sda`, `/dev/tty`, `/dev/null`   |
| `/tmp`        | Temporary files created by programs. Cleared automatically on reboot.                               | -                                      |
| `/boot`       | Boot loader files required to boot the system.                                                      | `vmlinuz`, `initrd.img`, `grub.cfg`   |
| `/lib`        | Shared libraries required by executables in `/bin` and `/sbin`.                                     | `libc.so.6`                           |

| `/mnt`        | Temporary mount points for file systems during maintenance.                                         | -                                      |

## Key Notes
- Directories like `/etc`, `/var`, and `/lib` are critical for administrators.  
- `/bin/` and `/sbin` contains executeable binaries, the differences lies in one provide user level binaries and one provide system level binaries
- User files and directories are stored under `/home`. Usually with format like `/home/${USER}`
- `/proc` and `/sys` provide live system data for debugging and monitoring.
