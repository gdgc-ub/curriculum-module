# File Permissions

In Linux, file permissions are a crucial aspect of system security and functionality. They control who can read, write, and execute files. By setting appropriate permissions, we can prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive data from being modified or deleted. Understanding file permissions is one step to be a Cloud Developer because most of the time, you will work with servers, containers, and cloud environments that runs on linux.

## Permission Categories

<img src="https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/linux_basics/mode.png" style="width: 100%">

The file permissions system in Linux is divided into three main categories.

1. User (Owner): The person who owns the file.
2. Group: The group that has permissions to the file.
3. Others: All other users who are not the owner or part of the group.

Each of these categories has four basic types of permissions:

1. Read (r): Allows the user to see or view the contents of a file.
2. Write (w): Allows the user to modify the contents of a file.
3. Execute (x): Allows the user to run a file as a program or script.
4. No Permission (-): Doesn't allow user to view, modifiy or run a file

Permissions are represented as a 10-character string in the output of the ls -l command, where each character indicates a specific permission setting.

```zsh
# this means user mentor, group mentor and others had 
# access to read, write and execute this file
-rwxrwxr-x 1 mentor mentor 1766 Nov 29 10:08 cleanup.sh 

#this means user mentor, group cloud can read and write 
# but can't execute this file, others can only read this file
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mentor mentor 22115 Nov 29 09:48 install-docker.sh 
```

## Permission Representation

In Linux, file or directory permissions can be represented in two ways:

### 1. Symbolic or string (rwx)

Permissions are represented as a string of characters for 4 categories:

| Symbol | Description       |
|--------|-------------------|
| `r`    | Read permission   |
| `w`    | Write permission  |
| `x`    | Execute permission |
| `-`    | No permission     |

For example:
- `rwx`: Read, write, and execute permissions.
- `rw-`: Read and write permissions, no execute.
- `r--`: Read-only permission.
- `-w-`: Write-only permission.
- `r-x`: Read and execute permissions, no write.

### 2. Numeric (octal) notation (0-7)


In numeric notation, each permission is represented by a number:

| Permission | Value |
|------------|-------|
| `r` (read) | 4     |
| `w` (write)| 2     |
| `x` (execute) | 1 |
| `-` (none) | 0     |

Each category (owner, group, and others) has a permission value, which is the sum of these numbers:

#### Common Examples:
| Symbolic | Numeric | Calculation        |
|----------|---------|--------------------|
| `rwx`    | `7`     | 4 (read) + 2 (write) + 1 (execute) |
| `rw-`    | `6`     | 4 (read) + 2 (write) + 0 (no execute) |
| `r-x`    | `5`     | 4 (read) + 0 (no write) + 1 (execute) |
| `r--`    | `4`     | 4 (read) + 0 (no write) + 0 (no execute) |
| `wx-`    | `3`     | 0 (no read) + 2 (write) + 1 (execute) |
| `---`    | `0`     | 0 (no read) + 0 (no write) + 0 (no execute) |


## Simple Case

Now how do we change the owner or the file permissions? We can use `chmod` command to change file or direcotry permissions and `chown` to change the owner of the file (user/group).

| Command       | Purpose                              | Example Usage                              |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `chmod`       | Changes file or directory permissions. | `chmod u+x file.sh` (Add execute for user) |
| `chown`       | Changes the owner (user/group) of a file or directory. | `chown user:group file.sh` (Set owner to `user` and group to `group`) |
| `chmod -R`    | Recursively changes permissions for directories and their contents. | `chmod -R 755 folder/` (Set folder and it's contents to `rwxr-xr-x`) |
| `chown -R`    | Recursively changes ownership for directories and their contents. | `chown -R user:group folder/` (Set ownership for folder and contents) |


1. Create a file called `installer.sh`

```zsh
touch installer.sh
```

2. See the file permissions by using `ls -l` command

```zsh
ls -l
```

The output would be like this
```zsh
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mentor mentor 0 Nov 30 02:51 installer.sh
```

That means `installer.sh` is a file because the first character represented as `-` and not `d`, the user mentor has access to read and write the file, the group mentor has access to read and write without execute but others can only read the file

3. Now we want to make this file executeable only for user mentor. To achieve that, we can use this command
```zsh
chmod u+x installer.sh
```

It means we will add execute permission to user category. As you can see the user is represented by `u` character, for group it's represented as `g` character and other is represented as `o` character. We can give all including user, group and others by using `a` character. Adding or removing permissions can be done using `+` and `-` symbols.

- `+` : Adds the specified permission(s) to the specified category (user, group, or others).
- `-` : Removes the specified permission(s) from the specified category.

4. We don't want others to read the file. To achieve that, simply type this command

```zsh
chmod o-r installer.sh
```

5. If you run the command already and see the file detail, it should be like this
```zsh
-rwxrw---- 1 mentor mentor 0 Nov 30 02:51 installer.sh
```

It means user mentor can read, write and execute `installer.sh` file, group mentor can only read and write the file and others can't read, write or even execute the file.

6. Now run this command to write the file's content into installer.sh file

```zsh
echo -e '#!/bin/bash\necho "HELLO WORLD"' > installer.sh
```

7. After that, try to execute the shell script by running this command

```zsh
./installer.sh
```

If `HELLO WORLD` displays in your terminal, it means you are in the right path! 

8. Now we want to make others and group can also read, write and execute this file. To do that, we can use `chmod` with numeric permission representation

```zsh
chmod 777 installer.sh
```

9. If you run `ls -l`, it should give you output like this

```zsh
-rwxrwxrwx 1 mentor mentor 31 Nov 30 03:03 installer.sh
```

10. Now we want to move ownership of this file to a user called `dev` with group `cloud`. First we create the user `dev` and group `cloud`

```zsh
sudo useradd dev
sudo groupadd cloud
```

11. Then we can change the ownership with `chown` command 

```zsh
sudo chown dev:cloud installer.sh
```

12. Try to see the changes by using `ls -l` command

```zsh
ls -l
```

It should be like this
```zsh
-rwxrwxrwx 1 dev cloud 31 Nov 30 03:03 installer.sh
```
