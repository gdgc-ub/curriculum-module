# Linux File Operations

Sometimes when you are accessing a linux server, you can only access the shell without GUI. This is common in real world scenario where typically, you can only access your server through SSH and the server doesn't have GUI because it's not really required to perform many operations like creating folder. In these cases, you rely heavily on command-line tools to navigate the file system, manage files, and perform other administrative tasks.

Linux, being a powerful and flexible operating system, provides a set of easily typeable and readable commands for performing file operations, such as creating, deleting, copying, moving, and searching files. 

## Table of Linux Essential File Operations

| **Command**      | **Description**                                   | **Example**                        |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `ls`             | Lists files and directories in the current directory. | `ls -l` (detailed listing)          |
| `cd`             | Changes the current directory.                   | `cd /home/user/Documents`           |
| `pwd`            | Prints the current working directory.            | `pwd`                               |
| `touch`          | Creates an empty file or updates the timestamp.  | `touch file.txt`                    |
| `mkdir`          | Creates a new directory.                         | `mkdir new_folder`                  |
| `rmdir`          | Removes an empty directory.                      | `rmdir empty_folder`                |
| `rm`             | Removes files or directories.                    | `rm file.txt`, `rm -r folder/`      |
| `cp`             | Copies files or directories.                     | `cp source.txt destination.txt`     |

| `cat`            | Displays the contents of a file.                 | `cat file.txt`                      |
| `less`/`more`    | Views file contents one screen at a time.         | `less file.txt`, `more file.txt`    |
| `head`           | Displays the first few lines of a file.          | `head -n 5 file.txt`                |

## Listing Files, Directories and Detail 

1. To see list of files and directories in current directory, you can use `ls` command
```zsh
ls
```

In my case, it give the output like this

```cpp
mentor@firstvm:~$ ls
cleanup.sh  cloud-simple-dockerfile-study  htmx-go-blog  install-docker.sh  main.cpp  setup-vps.sh
```

To see a more detailed information for each files and directories, you can pass `-l` flag like this
```zsh
ls -l
```

In my case, it give the output like this

```zsh
total 44
-rwxrwxr-x 1 mentor mentor  1766 Nov 29 10:08 cleanup.sh
drwxrwxr-x 4 mentor mentor  4096 Nov 23 11:37 cloud-simple-dockerfile-study
drwxrwxr-x 3 mentor mentor  4096 Nov 18 15:35 htmx-go-blog
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mentor mentor 22115 Nov 29 09:48 install-docker.sh
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mentor mentor    26 Nov 19 09:49 main.cpp
-rwxrwxr-x 1 mentor mentor  3368 Nov 29 10:21 setup-vps.sh
```

Now what each line means? Let's explore each of them

| #   | Field                | Description                                                                                      |
|-----|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `drwxrwxr-x`          | **File Permissions**: This shows the access permissions for the file or directory:               |
|     |                      | - `d` indicates it's a **directory**. If it's only `-` then it means it's a file                                                            |
|     |                      | - The first set of `rwx` indicates the **owner** (read, write, execute permissions).            |
|     |                      | - The second set of `rwx` indicates the **group** (read, write, execute permissions).           |
|     |                      | - The third set of `r-x` indicates **others** (read and execute, no write permissions).         |
| 2   | `3`                   | **Number of Links**: This indicates how many hard links exist for the file or directory.        |
| 3   | `mentor`              | **Owner**: The username of the user who owns the file or directory. In this case, it's `mentor`. |
| 4   | `mentor`              | **Group**: The group that owns the file or directory. Here, it's the `mentor` group.             |
| 5   | `4096`                | **File Size**: The size of the file or directory in bytes. Directories typically show 4096 bytes. |
| 6   | `Nov 18 15:35`        | **Date and Time**: The last modification date and time of the file or directory.                |
|     |                      | It was last modified on **November 18th at 15:35** (3:35 PM).                                    |
| 7   | `htmx-go-blog`        | **File/Directory Name**: The name of the file or directory, in this case, `htmx-go-blog`.         |

## Simple Case

In this section, we will go through a simple case to understand basic file operations. 

1. Create a new directory called project-files in your home directory.

2. Navigate into the project-files directory.

3. Create an empty file called README.md inside project-files.

4. Check if the file README.md is created by listing the files in the directory.

5. Create a new file called index.html in the project-files directory.

6. List all files again, but this time use a detailed view (including permissions, file sizes, etc.).

7. Move the file index.html into a subdirectory named html-files.

8. Rename the file README.md to PROJECT_README.md.

9. Check the contents of the directory to confirm the file renaming was successful.

10. Check current directory size usage.

11. Delete the index.html file from the html-files directory.

12. Navigate back to the home directory.

13. Remove the project-files directory along with all its contents.
