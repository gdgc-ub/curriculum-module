# Linux System Management

Managing a Linux system efficiently requires understanding various aspects of its operation. This guide explores key areas of system management, including processes, users, groups, packages, and services.

## 1. Process Management

Processes are instances of running programs. Managing processes involves monitoring, starting, stopping, or prioritizing them to ensure the system operates smoothly.

### Key Commands:
- `ps` – Displays running processes.
- `top` – Interactive process viewer.
- `htop` – Advanced interactive process viewer.
- `kill` – Stops a process by its PID.
- `killall` – Stops processes by name.
- `nice`/`renice` – Adjusts process priority.

### Examples:
```bash
ps aux           # List all running processes.
kill 1234        # Terminate the process with PID 1234.
renice -10 1234  # Increase the priority of process 1234.
```

## 2. User Management

User management is crucial for controlling system access and permissions.
Key Commands:

    adduser – Adds a new user interactively.
    useradd – Adds a user with more control but less interactivity.
    passwd – Changes or sets a user's password.
    usermod – Modifies user details.
    deluser – Deletes a user and optionally removes their files.

Examples:
```zsh
sudo adduser bocchi        # Create a new user named bocchi.
sudo passwd bocchi         # Set or change password for bocchi.
sudo deluser bocchi        # Delete the user bocchi
```

## 3. Group Management

Groups allow administrators to manage permissions collectively for multiple users.
Key Commands:

    groupadd – Creates a new group.
    groupdel – Deletes an existing group.
    usermod -aG – Adds a user to a group.
    groups – Displays the groups a user belongs to.

Examples:
```zsh
sudo groupadd cloud                 # Create a new group named cloud.
sudo usermod -aG cloud dvn          # Add user dvn to the cloud group.
groups dvn                          # List groups that dvn is part of.
```

## 4. Package Management

Package management involves installing, updating, and removing software packages. The commands vary based on the Linux distribution.
Key Commands:
Debian-Based Systems (e.g., Ubuntu):
```zsh
sudo apt install    # Installs a new package.
sudo apt remove     # Removes a package.
sudo apt update     # Updates the package list.
sudo apt upgrade    # Installs available package updates.
```

## 5. Service Management

Services (or daemons) are background processes that manage various system functions.
Key Commands:
```zsh
sudo systemctl start         # Starts a service.
sudo systemctl stop          # Stops a service.
sudo systemctl restart       # Restarts a service.
sudo systemctl enable        # Enables a service to start on boot.
sudo systemctl disable       # Disables a service from starting on boot.
sudo systemctl status        # Displays the status of a service.
```

Examples:
```zsh
sudo systemctl start nginx    # Start the nginx service.
sudo systemctl stop nginx     # Stop the nginx service.
sudo systemctl restart nginx  # Restart the nginx service.
sudo systemctl status nginx   # Check the status of the nginx service.
```
