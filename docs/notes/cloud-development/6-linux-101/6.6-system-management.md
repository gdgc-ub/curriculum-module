# Linux System Management

Managing a Linux system efficiently requires understanding various aspects of its operation. This guide explores key areas of system management, including processes, users, groups, packages, and services.

---

## 1. Process Management

Processes are instances of running programs. Managing processes involves monitoring, starting, stopping, or prioritizing them to ensure the system operates smoothly.

### Key Commands:
- `ps` – Displays running processes.
- `top` – Interactive process viewer.
- `htop` – Advanced interactive process viewer.
- `kill` – Stops a process by its PID.
- `killall` – Stops processes by name.
- `nice`/`renice` – Adjusts process priority.

### Examples:
```bash
ps aux           # List all running processes.
kill 1234        # Terminate the process with PID 1234.
renice -10 1234  # Increase the priority of process 1234.


User Management

User management is crucial for controlling system access and permissions.
Key Commands:

    adduser – Adds a new user interactively.
    useradd – Adds a user with more control but less interactivity.
    passwd – Changes or sets a user's password.
    usermod – Modifies user details.
    deluser – Deletes a user and optionally removes their files.

Examples:

sudo adduser alice        # Create a new user named alice.
sudo passwd alice         # Set or change password for alice.
sudo deluser alice        # Delete the user alice

3. Group Management

Groups allow administrators to manage permissions collectively for multiple users.
Key Commands:

    groupadd – Creates a new group.
    groupdel – Deletes an existing group.
    usermod -aG – Adds a user to a group.
    groups – Displays the groups a user belongs to.

Examples:

sudo groupadd developers         # Create a new group named developers.
sudo usermod -aG developers bob  # Add user bob to the developers group.
groups bob                       # List groups that bob is part of.


4. Package Management

Package management involves installing, updating, and removing software packages. The commands vary based on the Linux distribution.
Key Commands:
Debian-Based Systems (e.g., Ubuntu):

    apt install – Installs a new package.
    apt remove – Removes a package.
    apt update – Updates the package list.
    apt upgrade – Installs available package updates.

    Service Management

Services (or daemons) are background processes that manage various system functions.
Key Commands:

    systemctl start – Starts a service.
    systemctl stop – Stops a service.
    systemctl restart – Restarts a service.
    systemctl enable – Enables a service to start on boot.
    systemctl disable – Disables a service from starting on boot.
    systemctl status – Displays the status of a service.

Examples:

sudo systemctl start apache2    # Start the Apache2 service.
sudo systemctl stop apache2     # Stop the Apache2 service.
sudo systemctl restart apache2  # Restart the Apache2 service.
sudo systemctl status apache2   # Check the status of the Apache2 service.
