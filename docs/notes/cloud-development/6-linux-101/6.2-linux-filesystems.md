Every operating systems rely on a element called filesystem that manages, stores and retrieves data efficiently from storage devices such as SSD, HDD and USB drivers. Many variants of filesystems has emerged and each of them has its own purposes. We will only discover some of the more known filesystems.

## Ext4

Ext4 is the most widely used and default file system for many Linux distributions. It is the successor to Ext3 and comes with various improvements, including better performance, increased file size limits, and faster file system checks. Ext4 is known for its robustness, journaling capabilities, and backward compatibility with Ext2 and Ext3.

Some of the advantages are high performance for most workloads, reliable journaling and support large files and partition sizes.

## Btrfs

Btrfs is a modern, advanced file system designed to address the limitations of older file systems. It offers features such as snapshot support, data deduplication, RAID, and online defragmentation. Btrfs also enables the user to expand or shrink file systems on-the-fly, making it a flexible choice for both single and multi-disk setups.

Some of the advantages are built-in integrity with checksums, efficient space usage through data compression and deduplication and snapshots for easy system backups and recovery.

## XFS

XFS is a high-performance, journaling file system that excels in handling large files and massive storage volumes. Initially developed by Silicon Graphics (SGI), XFS has found its way into many Linux distributions due to its exceptional scalability and stability.

Some of the advantages are efficient handling large files and file systems, excellent performance for parallel I/O operations and robust jorunaling for data protection.

## F2FS

F2FS or Flash-Friendly File System is optimized for use with flash-based storage devices like SSDs and eMMC. It aims to minimize write amplification and extend the lifespan of flash storage by reducing unnecessary writes. F2FS performs well in scenarios where traditional file systems might struggle, making it an excellent choice for embedded devices and smartphones.

Some of the advantages are efficient wear leveling for flash storage, improved performance on flash based devices and reduced write overhead, leading to longer flash storage life.
