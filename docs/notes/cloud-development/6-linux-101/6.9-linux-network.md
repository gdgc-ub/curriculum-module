# Linux Networking

Linux provides powerful tools for networking, enabling system administrators and users to configure, manage, and troubleshoot network connections. Here are some key points related to Linux networking:

## 1. **Basic Network Configuration**

- Linux allows you to configure network interfaces using files or tools like `ifconfig`, `ip`, or `nmcli`.
- **`ifconfig`** is an older command used to configure network interfaces:
  ```bash
  ifconfig eth0 up      # Enable network interface eth0
  ifconfig eth0 down    # Disable network interface eth0
  ```
- **`ip`** is the modern tool used for network configuration:
  ```bash
  ip addr show          # Display all network interfaces
  ip link set eth0 up   # Enable eth0 interface
  ip link set eth0 down # Disable eth0 interface
  ```

## 2. **Network Interface Configuration Files**

- On Debian-based distributions, network settings are often configured in `/etc/network/interfaces`, while Red Hat-based distributions use `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface>`.
- Example (`/etc/network/interfaces`):
  ```bash
  auto eth0
  iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.1.10
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.1.1
  ```

## 3. **IP Address Management**

- **Static IP**: Assigning a fixed IP address to an interface.
- **Dynamic IP**: Obtaining an IP address via DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
  - To obtain an IP address dynamically:
    ```bash
    sudo dhclient eth0
    ```

## 4. **Network Routing**

- Routing determines how data is forwarded between devices on a network.
- You can view the routing table with the command:
  ```bash
  ip route show
  ```
- To add a new route:
  ```bash
  sudo ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1
  ```
- To delete a route:
  ```bash
  sudo ip route del 192.168.2.0/24
  ```

## 5. **DNS Configuration**

- DNS (Domain Name System) is used to resolve domain names to IP addresses.
- The DNS settings are typically configured in `/etc/resolv.conf`.
  Example:
  ```bash
  nameserver 8.8.8.8
  nameserver 8.8.4.4
  ```
- You can test DNS resolution using `nslookup` or `dig`:
  ```bash
  nslookup google.com
  dig google.com
  ```

## 6. **Network Testing and Troubleshooting**

- **Ping**: Used to test the reachability of a host and measure round-trip time.
  ```bash
  ping 8.8.8.8
  ping google.com
  ```
- **Traceroute**: Tracks the route packets take to reach a destination.
  ```bash
  traceroute google.com
  ```
- **Netstat**: Displays network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.
  ```bash
  netstat -tuln  # List all listening ports
  ```

## 7. **Firewall Configuration**

- Firewalls in Linux are usually configured using `iptables` (for older versions) or `nftables` (for newer versions).
- To list all active firewall rules using `iptables`:
  ```bash
  sudo iptables -L
  ```
- To add a rule to allow HTTP traffic:
  ```bash
  sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
  ```
- With **UFW** (Uncomplicated Firewall), managing the firewall is easier:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow ssh        # Allow SSH traffic
  sudo ufw enable           # Enable the firewall
  sudo ufw status           # Check firewall status
  ```

## 8. **Network Service Management**

- Linux uses **systemd** or **SysVinit** for managing network services.
- You can check the status of network services:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status networking
  ```
- Restart the network service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart networking
  ```

## 9. **Network Monitoring Tools**

- **Netstat**: Displays active network connections and listening ports.
  ```bash
  netstat -tuln
  ```
- **ss**: A modern tool to display socket statistics.
  ```bash
  ss -tuln
  ```
- **iftop**: Displays bandwidth usage on an interface.
  ```bash
  sudo apt install iftop
  sudo iftop
  ```

## 10. **Network File Sharing**

- **NFS (Network File System)** allows you to share directories over the network.
  - To install NFS server:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
    ```
  - To configure exports:
    ```bash
    echo "/shared_directory *(rw,sync)" | sudo tee -a /etc/exports
    sudo exportfs -a
    sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
    ```
- **Samba**: Used for file and printer sharing between Linux and Windows systems.
  - Install Samba:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install samba
    ```
  - Configure `/etc/samba/smb.conf` for shared directories.

## 11. **VPN Configuration**

- Linux supports various VPN protocols, including **OpenVPN**, **IPsec**, and **WireGuard**.
- To install and configure **OpenVPN**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install openvpn
  sudo openvpn --config client.ovpn
  ```

## 12. **Network Bonding**

- Network bonding allows you to combine multiple network interfaces to increase bandwidth or provide redundancy.
- To configure bonding:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install ifenslave
  sudo modprobe bonding
  ```
  Then, configure the bonding settings in the network configuration file.

## 13. **Proxy Configuration**

- Linux can be configured to route network traffic through a proxy server.
- Example for setting proxy for `apt`:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/proxy.conf
  Acquire::http::Proxy "http://proxy.example.com:8080";
  ```

## 14. **Wi-Fi Management**

- **NetworkManager** or **Wicd** is used to manage wireless networks.
- To view available Wi-Fi networks using `nmcli`:
  ```bash
  nmcli device wifi list
  ```
- To connect to a Wi-Fi network:
  ```bash
  nmcli device wifi connect "SSID" password "your_password"
  ```

## 15. **SSH Tunneling**

- SSH tunneling allows you to forward network traffic securely over an encrypted SSH connection.
- Example to forward local port 8080 to a remote server:
  ```bash
  ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 user@remote_host
  ```
