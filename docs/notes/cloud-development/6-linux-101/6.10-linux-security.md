# Linux Security

Linux is known for its strong security features, but securing a Linux system requires proper configuration and understanding of various security measures. Here are some key points for securing a Linux system:

## 1. **User and Group Management**

- Properly manage users and groups to enforce the principle of least privilege.
- Use the `useradd`, `groupadd`, and `usermod` commands to create, modify, and assign users to groups.
- Remove unnecessary accounts using `userdel`.
- Example command to add a user:
  ```bash
  sudo useradd -m username
  sudo passwd username
  ```

## 2. **Permissions and Ownership**

- Use `chmod` to control file permissions (read, write, execute) for users and groups.
- Use `chown` to set file ownership.
- Example commands to manage permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod 755 file_name     # Gives read, write, execute permission to owner, and read-execute to others
  chown user:group file_name  # Changes file owner and group
  ```

## 3. **Firewall Configuration**

- Use firewall tools like **UFW** (Uncomplicated Firewall) or **firewalld** to manage network access.
- Example to enable UFW:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw enable
  sudo ufw allow ssh  # Allow SSH connections
  sudo ufw deny 80    # Deny HTTP port
  ```

## 4. **SSH Hardening**

- Disable root login via SSH by modifying the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file and setting `PermitRootLogin no`.
- Use SSH keys for authentication rather than passwords for stronger security.
- Example to configure SSH key-based authentication:
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048   # Generate SSH key pair
  ssh-copy-id user@remote_host  # Copy public key to remote server
  ```

## 5. **Sudo Usage**

- Avoid giving unnecessary sudo privileges to users. Use `sudo` sparingly.
- Regular users should not have root access unless absolutely necessary.
- You can configure `sudo` access by editing the `/etc/sudoers` file using `visudo`.
  Example:
  ```bash
  sudo visudo
  # Add users with specific command access:
  username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt
  ```

## 6. **SELinux/AppArmor**

- Use **SELinux** (Security-Enhanced Linux) or **AppArmor** for mandatory access control (MAC).
- SELinux can be configured in Enforcing, Permissive, or Disabled modes.
- Check SELinux status:
  ```bash
  getenforce
  sudo setenforce Enforcing  # Set SELinux to Enforcing mode
  ```

## 7. **Software Updates**

- Regularly update the system to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Use the package manager to install security updates.
  Example:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade   # Debian-based
  sudo yum update                      # RHEL-based
  ```

## 8. **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**

- Use tools like **Fail2ban** or **AIDE** (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) to monitor and respond to suspicious activities.
- Fail2ban helps block IPs that attempt to break into your system through brute force attacks (e.g., SSH).
  Example:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install fail2ban
  sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
  ```

## 9. **Log Monitoring**

- Monitor log files for any unusual activity using tools like **logwatch** or **syslog**.
- Example to view system logs:
  ```bash
  tail -f /var/log/syslog     # Monitor system log
  journalctl -xe             # View systemd logs
  ```

## 10. **Encryption**

- Encrypt sensitive data using tools like **GPG** or **LUKS** (Linux Unified Key Setup).
- Encrypt the entire disk with **LUKS** during installation or after with `cryptsetup`.
- Use GPG for encrypting files:
  ```bash
  gpg -c file_name  # Encrypt a file with a passphrase
  ```

## 11. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

- Enable **two-factor authentication** for SSH or other services where security is critical.
- Install and configure `pam_google_authenticator` for 2FA.
  Example:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator
  google-authenticator   # Set up 2FA for the user
  ```

## 12. **Auditing**

- Use **auditd** (Audit Daemon) for auditing system calls, user actions, and security-relevant events.
- Install and configure `auditd`:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install auditd
  sudo service auditd start
  ```

## 13. **Backup Strategy**

- Ensure regular backups of critical files and configurations. Use tools like **rsync**, **tar**, or third-party software.
- Example:
  ```bash
  rsync -av --delete /home/ user@backup:/backup/  # Backup home directory
  ```

## 14. **Physical Security**

- Restrict physical access to the server to authorized personnel only.
- Consider using a BIOS password and booting from read-only media.
- Disable unused hardware ports (e.g., USB, CD/DVD) to prevent unauthorized access.

## 15. **Disabling Unnecessary Services**

- Disable unused services to minimize the attack surface.
- List active services:
  ```bash
  systemctl list-units --type=service
  ```
- Disable unnecessary services:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop service_name
  sudo systemctl disable service_name
  ```
