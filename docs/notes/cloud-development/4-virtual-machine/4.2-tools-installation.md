To create virtual machine inside our computer, of course we need an operating system. For this one, we will use linux, specifically ubuntu server. 

### So What is Linux? 

Linux is an open source operating system developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991.  Linux is known for its reliability, security, and flexibility, making it widely used in personal devices, servers, and cloud environments. Linux has many distributions or what we call "distros" which are variations of linux that bundle the kernel with additional software to create complete operating system. One of the most popular distro is Ubuntu. Ubuntu itself is open source and free, lightweight and includes a vast repository of software packages and tools for server management, web hosting, and application deployment.
