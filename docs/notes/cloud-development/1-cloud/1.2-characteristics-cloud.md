### 1. **On-Demand Self-Service**

Users can instantly access resources like storage or virtual machines through a portal or API without waiting for IT support. For example, you can launch a server on platforms like AWS or Azure in minutes, saving time and improving efficiency.

---

### 2. **Broad Network Access**

Cloud services are available from anywhere, using devices like laptops, tablets, or smartphones. All you need is an internet connection. For instance, teams can collaborate remotely using tools like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365, making work seamless and accessible globally.

---

### 3. **Resource Pooling**

Cloud providers share resources like servers and storage among multiple users, optimizing costs and performance. You donâ€™t need to know where your data is physically storedâ€”just enjoy high availability and scalability. Platforms like AWS and Google Cloud use this model to serve millions efficiently.

---

### 4. **Rapid Elasticity**

Cloud computing adjusts resources automatically based on demand. For example, during a holiday sale, an e-commerce website can handle a surge in traffic by scaling up resources. Once the traffic reduces, it scales down to save costs.

---

### 5. **Measured Service**

With a pay-as-you-go model, youâ€™re billed for exactly what you useâ€”whether itâ€™s storage, processing power, or bandwidth. For example, AWS provides detailed reports on usage, helping businesses control their costs effectively.

Cloud computingâ€™s flexibility, accessibility, and efficiency make it a game-changer for businesses, enabling them to adapt and grow in todayâ€™s fast-paced world.
