Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services such as storage, processing power, databases, networking, software, and more over the internet. It enables users to access these resources on-demand without owning physical infrastructure, providing greater flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency. "The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies do not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.

The cloud is like a massive library for technology. Instead of owning every book or resource yourself, you borrow exactly what you need, only when you need it. This library has endless shelves, allowing it to expand or shrink based on your requirements (scalability), and you can access it from anywhere, whether you're at home, at work, or traveling (availability). You donâ€™t have to worry about maintaining the libraryâ€”itâ€™s fully managed, ensuring everything stays organized, up-to-date, and secure (managed services). Best of all, you only pay for the time and resources you actually use, rather than investing in the entire collection (cost-efficiency). Just as libraries democratize access to knowledge, the cloud democratizes access to powerful computing and storage capabilities for everyone.

## Drawbacks of Traditional Computing

![Drawbacks of Traditional Computing](https://www.aztechit.co.uk/hs-fs/hubfs/cloud%20computing%20vs%20traditional%20computing.webp?width=1376&height=776&name=cloud%20computing%20vs%20traditional%20computing.webp)

Traditional computing models, where companies rely on on-premises hardware and software, face several challenges:

1. High Initial Costs

   - Requires significant upfront investment in hardware, software, and IT - infrastructure.
   - Maintenance costs further increase the total expenditure.

---

2. Scalability Issues

   - Scaling infrastructure to meet increased demand often involves purchasing additional hardware, which is both expensive and time-consuming.
   - Underutilization of resources during periods of low demand leads to inefficiencies.

---

3. Limited Accessibility

   - Resources and applications are typically accessible only within a specific physical location.
   - Remote access requires complex setups like VPNs, which can be costly.

---

4. Complex Maintenance

   - Regular updates, patches, and hardware replacements require dedicated IT teams.
   - Downtime during maintenance can disrupt business operations.

---

5. Disaster Recovery Challenges

   - Setting up reliable disaster recovery and backup systems is complex and costly.
   - Data recovery after hardware failures can be slow and uncertain.

## Background of Cloud Computing

The concept of cloud computing evolved as a solution to overcome the limitations of traditional computing. Here is a brief history:

> 1960s: The Idea of Utility Computing
> John McCarthy proposed that "computation may someday be organized as a public utility." This idea laid the foundation for cloud computing.

---

> 1990s: Emergence of Virtualization
> Virtualization technology enabled multiple operating systems to run on a single machine, paving the way for resource pooling.

---

> 2000s: Rise of Cloud Services
> Companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft launched cloud-based services.
> Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched in 2006, offering scalable and pay-as-you-go infrastructure.

---

> 2010s: Widespread Adoption
> Cloud computing became mainstream, with organizations shifting critical workloads to the cloud to improve efficiency and reduce costs.

</div>

Cloud computing is based on the following core principles:

1. Virtualization

   Separates physical hardware from software, allowing multiple virtual machines to share the same physical resources.

---

2. Resource Pooling

   Computing resources such as storage, processing power, and bandwidth are pooled and shared among multiple users (multi-tenancy).

---

3. On-Demand Self-Service

   Users can provision resources like servers and storage without requiring manual intervention from service providers.

---

4. Scalability and Elasticity

   Resources can be automatically scaled up or down based on demand.

---

5. Measured Service

   Resource usage is monitored and billed based on actual consumption, following a pay-as-you-go model.

---

6. Broad Network Access

   Resources are accessible over the internet from various devices, enabling mobility and flexibility.

## Key Points Cloud Computing

1. Accessibility

   Users can access cloud services anytime, anywhere, using an internet connection.

---

2. Cost Efficiency

   Reduces capital expenses (CapEx) by converting them into operational expenses (OpEx).
   No need to purchase or maintain expensive hardware.

---

3. Flexibility and Scalability

   Resources can be scaled dynamically to match demand, ensuring optimal performance without over-provisioning.

---

4. Security

   Advanced security features such as encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems protect data and applications.

---

5. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

   Cloud providers offer robust backup and disaster recovery solutions, minimizing downtime.

---

6. Automation

   Many cloud platforms offer automated updates, scaling, and load balancing.

---

7. Innovation Enablement

   Provides the tools and platforms necessary for rapid development, testing, and deployment of applications.
