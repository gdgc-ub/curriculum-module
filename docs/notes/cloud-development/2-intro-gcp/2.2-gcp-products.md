It provides outbound internet connectivity for private resources in Google Cloud without exposing them directly to incoming internet traffic.

## 4. Data Analytics

GCP offers powerful data analytics tools, including [BigQuery](#bigquery) for fast, serverless data warehousing, [Dataflow](#dataflow) for real-time or batch data processing, and [Looker](#looker). 

Data analytics in the cloud enables businesses and individuals to process, analyze, and derive insights from vast amounts of data efficiently and at scale without having to buy more physical hardware or manage complex infrastructure that is probably only used once and then your company won't use it anymore.

### [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/?hl=en)

BigQuery is a fully-managed data analysis service that enables businesses to analyze Big Data. It features highly scalable data storage that accommodates up to hundreds of terabytes, the ability to perform ad hoc queries on multi-terabyte datasets, and the ability to share data insights via the web.

### [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/products/dataflow?hl=en)

Dataflow is a fully-managed service for strongly consistent, parallel data-processing pipelines. It provides an SDK for Java with composable primitives for building data-processing pipelines for batch or continuous processing. This service manages the life cycle of Compute Engine resources of the processing pipeline(s). It also provides a monitoring user interface for understanding pipeline health.

### [Looker](https://cloud.google.com/looker/?hl=en)

Looker (Google Cloud core) is a business intelligence and embedded analytics solution hosted on Google infrastructure. With Looker (Google Cloud core), customers can build semantic models using various data sources, develop customized insights from the models, and share those insights for collaboration via dashboards and other services.

## 5. AI/ML Services
