# Docker Containers

> This module explains how to work with Docker containers, including running, removing, and inspecting them, along with detailed explanations of commonly used flags.

::: details **Understanding Docker Containers** ðŸ“š

A **Docker container** is a runnable instance of a Docker image. It contains everything needed to run an application, including code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. Containers ensure the application behaves consistently across different environments.

- **Images**: Read-only templates used to create containers.
- **Containers**: Instances of images that can be started, stopped, or removed.
- **Dockerfile**: A script with instructions to build a Docker image.

## What is a Docker Container?

A Docker container is a runnable instance of a Docker image. It encapsulates an application and its dependencies in an isolated environment. Containers are lightweight, portable, and can be run, stopped, moved, and deleted independently.

---

## Why Use Docker Containers?

Imagine developing a web app with three components:

- React frontend
- Python API
- PostgreSQL database

To work on this project, youâ€™d need to install Node.js, Python, and PostgreSQL. But how do you ensure everyone on your team uses the same versions? Or that your app runs consistently across development, CI/CD, and production? How do you avoid conflicts with other software on your machine?

Docker containers solve these problems by packaging applications and dependencies into isolated units. Each container runs independently, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across different environments.

## Why Containers Are Awesome?

- **Self-contained**: Each container includes everything it needs to run, with no reliance on the host machineâ€™s pre-installed software.
- **Isolated**: Containers run separately, reducing the risk of conflicts and enhancing security.
- **Independent**: Containers are managed independently. Removing one wonâ€™t impact others.
- **Portable**: Containers work anywhere â€” your local machine, a data center, or the cloud.

## Containers vs. Virtual Machines (VMs)

- **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: Each VM includes an entire operating system, kernel, and drivers. This makes VMs resource-intensive.
- **Containers**: Containers share the hostâ€™s kernel, making them lightweight and allowing multiple containers to run on less infrastructure.

Using a VM for one app introduces significant overhead. Containers, being isolated processes, are much more efficient for running multiple applications.

## Docker Container Commands

### Docker Run

The `docker run` command is used to start a container from an image.

```bash
# Syntax

# Docker Images

> Docker images are the building blocks of containers. This module covers how to work with Docker images, including pulling, building, and pushing images to a registry.

## What is a Docker Image?

A container image is a packaged environment containing everything needed to run a container, including:

- Files, binaries, and libraries
- Configuration files
- Dependencies

For example:

- A PostgreSQL image includes database binaries, configuration files, and required dependencies.
- A Python app image contains the Python runtime, your app code, and its dependencies.

## Key Principles of Images

- Immutable: Once created, images cannot be modified. Changes require creating a new image or adding layers.
- Layered Structure: Images are built in layers, where each layer represents changes to the filesystem (e.g., adding or modifying files).

These principles allow you to build on existing images. For example, starting from a Python image, you can add layers for your appâ€™s dependencies and code, focusing only on your app.

## Where to Find Docker Images?

Docker Hub is the default marketplace for discovering, storing, and sharing container images. It includes:

- **Docker Official Images**: Curated, secure, and widely used images (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
- **Docker Verified Publishers**: High-quality images from verified companies.
- **Docker-Sponsored Open Source**: Images from open-source projects supported by Docker.

Examples:

- Ready-to-go services: Quickly run services like Redis or Memcached.
- Base images: Use base images like Node.js or Python as a starting point and customize with your files and configurations.

Docker Hub simplifies running services and starting app development with trusted, pre-configured images.

## Docker Image Commands

### Docker Search

The `docker search` command is used to search for images on Docker Hub.

```bash
# Syntax
docker search [OPTIONS] TERM
```

```bash
# Example: Search for Ubuntu images
docker search ubuntu
```

### Docker Pull

The `docker pull` command is used to download an image from a registry.

```bash
# Syntax
docker pull [OPTIONS] NAME[:TAG|@DIGEST]
```

```bash
# Example: Pull the latest Ubuntu image
docker pull ubuntu
```

#### Docker Pull Options

| Option       | Description                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `--all-tags` | Download all tagged images for the specified repo. |

### Docker Build

The `docker build` command is used to build an image from a Dockerfile.

```bash
# Syntax
docker build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -
```

```bash
# Example: Build an image from a Dockerfile in the current directory
docker build -t my-app .
```

#### Docker Build Options

| Option        | Description                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-t, --tag`   | Name and optionally a tag in the `name:tag` format.       |
| `--file`      | Name of the Dockerfile (default: `PATH/Dockerfile`).      |
| `--build-arg` | Set build-time variables.                                 |
| `--no-cache`  | Do not use cache when building the image.                 |
| `--network`   | Set the networking mode for the RUN instructions          |
| `--pull`      | Always attempt to pull a newer version of the base image. |

### Docker Push

The `docker push` command is used to push an image to a registry.

```bash
# Syntax
docker push [OPTIONS] NAME[:TAG]
```

```bash
# Example: Push an image to Docker Hub
docker push my-app
```

#### Docker Push Options

| Option       | Description                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `--all-tags` | Push all tagged images for the specified repo. |

### Docker Prune

The `docker image prune` command is used to remove unused images.

```bash
# Syntax
docker image prune [OPTIONS]
```

```bash
# Example: Remove unused images
docker image prune
```

#### Docker Prune Options

| Option      | Description                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `-a, --all` | Remove all unused images, not just dangling ones. |
