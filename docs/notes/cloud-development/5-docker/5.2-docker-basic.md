# Docker Basics

> This module introduces Docker, its key concepts, and essential commands to get you started with containerized applications.

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside lightweight, portable containers. It helps you build consistent environments for development, testing, and production.

## Key Concepts

- **Image**: A read-only template for creating containers.
- **Container**: A runnable instance of an image.
- **Dockerfile**: A text document with instructions to build an image.
- **Registry**: A storage for Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub).
- **Volumes**: Persistent storage for containers.
