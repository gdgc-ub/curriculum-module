# Docker Volumes

> Docker volumes provide a way to persist data generated and used by Docker containers. This module covers how Docker volumes work, the available commands and flags, and how to integrate volumes with containers.

## What is a Docker Volume?

A Docker volume is a mechanism to store data independently of a container's lifecycle. Volumes can be shared between multiple containers and are managed by Docker, making them a preferred way to handle persistent data.

### Key Features

- **Persistent storage**: Data remains even after the container is removed.
- **Shared storage**: Easily shared between multiple containers.
- **Docker-managed**: Docker handles volume location and lifecycle.

---

## How Docker Volumes Work

- Volumes are stored in Docker's file system, typically under `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`.
- You can create, inspect, and remove volumes independently of containers.
- Volumes are mounted into a container's filesystem, making the data accessible.

## Docker Volume Commands

### Creating a Volume

The `docker volume create` command creates a new volume.

```bash
# Syntax
docker volume create [OPTIONS] <volume_name>
```

```bash
# Example
docker volume create my_volume
```

### Listing Volumes

The `docker volume ls` command lists all volumes on the host.

```bash
docker volume ls
```

### Inspecting a Volume

The `docker volume inspect` command displays detailed information about a volume.

```bash
# Syntax
docker volume inspect <volume_name>
```

```bash
# Example
docker volume inspect my_volume
```

## Usecases for Docker Volumes

In this use case, we will mount an HTML file into an Nginx container, delete the container, and then recreate it to demonstrate the persistence of data using Docker volumes.

### Step 1: Create a Volume

First, create a Docker volume named `html_volume`.

```bash
docker volume create html_volume
```

### Step 2: Create an HTML File

Create a simple HTML file on your local machine.

```html
<!-- Save this as index.html -->
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Docker Volume Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello from Docker Volume!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Step 3: Run Nginx Container with Volume

Run an Nginx container and mount the `html_volume` to the Nginx default HTML directory.

```bash
docker run -d --name nginx_container -v html_volume:/usr/share/nginx/html -p 8080:80 nginx
```

### Step 4: Copy HTML File to Volume

Copy the `index.html` file to the volume.

```bash
docker cp index.html nginx_container:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

### Step 5: Verify HTML in Browser

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to see the HTML file served by Nginx.

### Step 6: Remove the Container

Stop and remove the Nginx container.

```bash
docker stop nginx_container
docker rm nginx_container
```

### Step 7: Recreate the Container

Recreate the Nginx container with the same volume.

```bash
docker run -d --name nginx_container -v html_volume:/usr/share/nginx/html -p 8080:80 nginx
```

### Step 8: Verify Persistence

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` again. You should still see the HTML file, demonstrating that the data persisted even after the container was removed and recreated.
