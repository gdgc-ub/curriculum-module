# 5.1 Introduction to Docker Containers

> Learn about Docker containers, their benefits, and how to create and interact with them.

Docker simplifies application deployment by providing a lightweight, isolated environment called a **container**. Containers are portable, efficient, and help streamline development and operations.

---

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It enables developers to package applications and their dependencies into containers, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

---

## Key Features of Docker Containers

- **Isolation**: Each container runs in its own environment without interference.
- **Portability**: Containers can run on any system with Docker installed, regardless of the underlying hardware or OS.
- **Efficiency**: Containers are lightweight compared to traditional virtual machines, using fewer resources.

::: details **Understanding Docker Containers** ğŸ“š

A **Docker container** is a runnable instance of a Docker image. It contains everything needed to run an application, including code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. Containers ensure the application behaves consistently across different environments.

- **Images**: Read-only templates used to create containers.
- **Containers**: Instances of images that can be started, stopped, or removed.
- **Dockerfile**: A script with instructions to build a Docker image.

## Hands-On with Docker Containers

Follow these steps to get started with Docker containers:

### 1. **Creating a Docker Container**

Use the `docker run` command to create and start a container. For example:

```bash
docker run -d --name my-container nginx
```

> -d: Runs the container in detached mode (background).
> --name: Assigns a name to the container.
> nginx: The image used to create the container.
