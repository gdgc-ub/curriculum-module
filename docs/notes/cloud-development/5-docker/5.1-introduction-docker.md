Docker is an open platform designed for developing, deploying, and running applications. It allows you to separate your applications from the underlying infrastructure, enabling faster software delivery. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure using the same methods you use to manage your applications.

## Docker as Platform

Docker allows you to package and run applications in a loosely isolated environment known as a container. This isolation and security enable multiple containers to run concurrently on a single host. Containers are efficient and include everything required to run the application, eliminating the need to depend on the host's installed software. You can share containers during development, ensuring that everyone who receives the container experiences the same functionality.

## Benefit of Docker

- **Fast and Consistent Delivery**: Docker simplifies the development lifecycle by enabling developers to work in standardized environments with containers. This enhances Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) workflows, making it easy to share, test, and deploy applications.

- **Responsive Deployment and Scaling**: Docker allows for highly portable workloads that can run on local machines, data centers, or cloud environments. It enables easy scaling of applications and services in near real time to meet changing business needs.

- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Docker is lightweight and fast, making it a cost-effective alternative to traditional virtual machines. It allows for higher density environments, maximizing server capacity while achieving business goals with fewer resources.

## Docker Architecture

![Docker Architecture](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/images/docker-architecture.webp)

Docker operates on a client-server model. The Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon, which is responsible for the creation, execution, and distribution of Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same machine, or you can link a client to a remote daemon. They interact using a REST API, either through UNIX sockets or a network interface. Another tool, Docker Compose, allows you to manage applications that consist of multiple containers. Additionally, Docker uses a registry, which is a storage location for container images that can be accessed by the Docker client to pull and push container images.

## Terms and Concepts

1. Docker Daemon

The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects like images, containers, networks, and volumes. It can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.

2. Docker Client

The Docker client (docker) is the main interface for users to interact with Docker. Commands like `docker run` are sent to the daemon (dockerd) to execute. The Docker client can interact with multiple daemons

3. Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for macOS, Windows, and Linux. It provides tools for building and sharing containerized applications and microservices, and includes:

- Docker daemon (dockerd)
- Docker client (docker)
- Docker Compose
- Kubernetes
- Credential Helper

4. Docker Registry

A Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry used by default, but you can also use your own private registry. Commands like `docker pull` fetch images from the registry, while `docker push` uploads your image to it.

5. Docker Objects

Docker uses several key objects:

- Images: Read-only templates with instructions for creating containers. They can be based on other images with customizations.
- Containers: Runnable instances of images that you can start, stop, or modify.
- Networks: Virtual networks that containers can connect to.
- Volumes: Persistent storage used by containers.

6. Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure the application's services, networks, and volumes. With Compose, you can start all the services from your configuration with a single command.

7. Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using `docker build`, you can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.
