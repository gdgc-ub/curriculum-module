# Docker Compose Module

> Docker Compose is a tool for defining and managing multi-container Docker applications. Using a YAML file, you can configure application services, networks, and volumes in a declarative manner.

![Docker Compose](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=1280,height=720,fit=cover,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2ykkgjyw1rdzzdsujule.png)

Docker Compose is a powerful tool for defining and running applications that require multiple containers. It streamlines development and deployment processes by managing services, networks, and volumes through a single YAML configuration file.

With Docker Compose, you can create and launch all services in your application stack using just one command. It works across various environments—production, staging, development, testing, and CI workflows—and provides tools to manage your application lifecycle, including:

- Starting, stopping, and rebuilding services.
- Viewing the status of running services.
- Streaming logs from active services.
- Running one-off commands for specific services.

## Benefits of Docker Compose

1. Simplified Control

Compose lets you define and manage all application services in a single YAML file, making it easier to orchestrate and coordinate multiple containers in a consistent environment.

2. Efficient Collaboration

The configuration file is shareable, enabling seamless collaboration between developers, operations teams, and other stakeholders. This leads to faster workflows and improved efficiency.

3. Faster Development

Compose caches container configurations. If you restart a service that hasn’t changed, Compose reuses existing containers, allowing you to quickly test changes and iterate on your environment.

4. Portability Across Environments

You can use variables in the Compose file to customize configurations for different environments or users, making your application portable and adaptable.

5. Vibrant Community Support

The large, active Docker Compose community ensures access to tutorials, resources, and troubleshooting help, fostering continuous improvement and ease of use.

## Common Use Cases of Docker Compose

1. Development Environments

Compose is ideal for creating isolated environments where you can run and interact with your application during development.

- Document and configure dependencies (e.g., databases, caches, APIs) in the Compose file.
- Start all services and dependencies with a single docker compose up command.

This approach simplifies project setup and eliminates the need for lengthy "getting started" guides, replacing them with a machine-readable file and a few commands.
Example: Starting a Development Environment

Suppose your app relies on a React frontend, a Python API, and a PostgreSQL database. Instead of setting up each service manually, you can define them in a Compose file and launch everything with one command.

Docker Compose reduces complexity, speeds up development, and ensures consistent environments across teams and systems.

## How Docker Compose Works

1. **Reads `docker-compose.yml`**:

   - Describes services, networks, and volumes.
   - Ensures all dependencies are configured.

2. **Creates a Default Network**:

   - Automatically creates a bridge network for the services unless explicitly defined.

3. **Starts Services**:
   - Launches containers in the defined order.
   - Handles inter-service communication automatically.

## Docker Compose File Structure

A `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services, networks, and volumes for your application. It follows a structured format with specific keywords and configurations.

### Version

The `version` field specifies the Compose file format version. It determines which Compose features and syntax are available.

```yaml
version: '3.8'
```

### Services

The `services` section defines the containers that make up your application. Each service has a name and configuration options.

#### Service Configuration Options

| Option        | Description                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `image`       | Image name and optional tag.                                   |
| `build`       | Build configuration (e.g., context, Dockerfile).               |
| `ports`       | Maps container ports to the host machine.                      |
| `volumes`     | Mounts host paths or named volumes into the container.         |
| `environment` | Defines environment variables for the container.               |
| `depends_on`  | Specifies dependencies (order in which services should start). |
| `networks`    | Configures the networks the service is part of.                |
| `command`     | Overrides the default command for the container.               |

```yaml
version: '3.9'

# Services define the containers in your application
services:
  app:
    # Use an image or build from Dockerfile
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: my-app:latest
    ports:
      - '3000:3000' # Host:Container port mapping
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: ${NODE_ENV} # Set environment variables, this syntax allows for variable substitution (from .env)
    depends_on:
      - db # Ensure 'db' service starts before 'app'

  db:
    image: postgres:13
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data # Use a named volume
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: app_db

# Volumes define persistent storage for containers
volumes:
  db_data:
```

## Docker Compose Commands

To run Docker Compose, use the `docker-compose` command followed by the desired action.

### Common Commands

### Example Commands with Variations

1. **Start Services in Detached Mode**:

   - Run all services in the background.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d  # Starts containers in detached mode
   ```

2. **Stop and Remove Containers**:

   - Stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes.

   ```bash
   docker-compose down  # Stops and removes containers
   ```

3. **Rebuild Images and Start Services**:

   - Force a rebuild of images before starting containers.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build  # Rebuild images and start containers
   ```

4. **Start Only Specific Services**:

   - Start only the `app` service.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up app  # Start only the 'app' service
   ```

5. **Stop All Services and Remove Containers**:

   - Stop all running containers and remove them.

   ```bash
   docker-compose down -v  # Stop and remove containers, networks, and volumes
   ```

6. **Scale Services**:

   - Scale the `app` service to run three containers.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --scale app=3  # Scale 'app' service to 3 containers
   ```

## Usecase for Docker Compose

In this use case, we will create a simple web application using Docker Compose. Clone this [sample repository](https://github.com/gdgc-ub/cloud-compose-study.git) to follow along.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the sample repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gdgc-ub/cloud-compose-study.git
cd cloud-compose-study
```

### Step 2: Create .env File

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following the .example.env variables:

```bash
# APP Config Variables
APP_ENV=development
APP_PORT=8080

# DB Config Variables
DB_HOST= ## fill with your db service name
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASS=postgres
DB_NAME=cloud_study_jam
```

### Step 3: Create Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root directory with the following configuration:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    container_name: htmxblogapp
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      context: .
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    volumes:
      - ./static/assets/storage:/app/static/assets/storage
    networks:
      - htmx-blog
    restart: always
  db:
    image: postgres:16.1
    container_name: htmxblogdb
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=${DB_USER}
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${DB_PASS}
      - POSTGRES_DB=${DB_NAME}
      - TZ=Asia/Jakarta
      - PORT=${DB_PORT}
    volumes:
      - htmxblogdb:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - htmx-blog
    ports:
      - '${DB_PORT}:${DB_PORT}'
    healthcheck:
      test: ['CMD-SHELL', "sh -c 'pg_isready -U ${DB_USER} -d ${DB_NAME}'"]
      start_interval: 5s
      interval: 15s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3

networks:
  htmx-blog:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  htmxblogdb:
```

since the name of the service is `db`, the `DB_HOST` in the `.env` file should be `db`.

### Step 4: Build and Run

Build and run the application using Docker Compose.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
