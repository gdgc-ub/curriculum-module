In today's fast-paced digital era, developers and businesses need reliable tools to build, scale, and manage their applications efficiently. They also want to quickly scale their infrastructure without spending excessive time and effort maintaining hardware. Imagine, you’re also part of them, and you want to deploy your application so your friends, your professor, and your parents can see your simple CRUD application. 

At first, it seems simple. "Lemme just buy a server, set up the network, the hardware, the software and host it all by myself". So you purchase a $100 server and start configuring it. But then, something unexpected happens. Your simple CRUD app goes viral, and now, millions of users are accessing your app simultaneously. Everything went messy because your server is struggling to keep up with the load and you find yourself struggling to scale it quickly.

At this point, you realize that managing hardware, network and server maintenance not only costly but also incredibly time consuming. This is where **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** comes to the rescue.
