# 3.3 Handling User Input (Forms, TextField, Buttons)

> Learn how to manage user interactions by using forms, text input fields, and buttons in Flutter apps.

In Flutter, handling user input is a core feature for creating interactive applications. By utilizing **Forms**, **TextField**, and **Button** widgets, you can efficiently collect and validate user input, making your app more dynamic and responsive.

::: details Overview of the Materials ðŸ“š

- **Forms in Flutter**: Forms are used to collect and validate user input. The `Form` widget manages multiple `TextFormField` widgets, and validation is handled using `GlobalKey<FormState>`.
- **TextField Widget**: A versatile widget for text input, allowing single-line or multi-line text collection. It can be customized with different keyboard types and validation logic.
- **Buttons in Flutter**: Common buttons like `ElevatedButton`, `TextButton`, and `IconButton` are used for user interactions. These buttons trigger actions, such as form submission or navigation.
- **Combining Widgets**: By combining `TextField`, `Form`, and `Button` widgets, you can build interactive forms that collect, validate, and submit user input.

## Forms

Forms are used to gather multiple pieces of user input, like name, email, or password, and validate them together. A form in Flutter is represented by the **Form** widget, which wraps **TextFormField** widgets (used for input fields). The form widget helps you manage form validation and saves input data easily.

```dart
Form(
  key: _formKey,
  child: Column(
    children: <Widget>[
      TextFormField(
        decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your name'),
        validator: (value) {
          if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
            return 'Name cannot be empty';
          }
          return null;
        },
      ),
      ElevatedButton(
        onPressed: () {
          if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) {
            // Proceed with form submission
          }
        },
        child: Text('Submit'),
      ),
    ],
  ),
),
```

### Key Concepts:

- **GlobalKeyFormState**: Itâ€™s used to identify the form and allows you to validate the fields.
- **FormField**: Each form field is usually a **TextFormField**, but can also be other types, depending on the data.
- **Validator**: You can add custom validation logic to the form fields to ensure data integrity.

::: tip Use Case

Forms are ideal for scenarios where you need to collect multiple pieces of information from users, such as during sign-up, login, or survey submission. The key to a smooth user experience is to ensure that the form is validated correctly and that appropriate feedback is provided when there are errors.

## TextField

The **TextField** widget is used for single-line or multi-line text input. Itâ€™s essential for collecting text data from the user, such as names, emails, and other text-based input.

TextField is very flexible and allows developers to customize it in various ways, such as controlling keyboard types (e.g., email or number keyboards), adding validation, and listening for changes in the text entered.

```dart
TextField(
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    hintText: 'Enter your name',
    labelText: 'Name',
  ),
  onChanged: (text) {
    print('Text entered: $text');
  },
),
```

## Buttons

Flutter provides various types of buttons to trigger actions within your app. **ElevatedButton**, **TextButton**, and **IconButton** are the most common buttons that developers use for various interactions.

Each button type has its use case. For example, an **ElevatedButton** is used for action-based triggers (e.g., submitting a form), while a **TextButton** is used for less prominent actions (e.g., canceling a form submission).

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    print('Button Pressed');
  },
  child: Text('Submit'),
),
```

## Combining TextField, Form, and Button

By combining the above widgets, you can create a fully functional form that collects user input, validates it, and triggers an action when the user submits the data.

When combining these widgets, itâ€™s important to ensure that user input is validated before submission and that the user is notified of any errors. Additionally, buttons play an essential role in triggering the action after the form is successfully validated.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyFormState createState() => _MyFormState();
}

class _MyFormState extends State<MyForm> {
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();

  String _name = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Form Example')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Form(
          key: _formKey,
          child: Column(
            children: [
              TextFormField(
                decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter your name'),
                validator: (value) {
                  if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
                    return 'Name cannot be empty';
                  }
                  return null;
                },
                onSaved: (value) {
                  _name = value!;
                },
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  if (_formKey.currentState?.validate() ?? false) {
                    _formKey.currentState?.save();
                    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context)
                        .showSnackBar(SnackBar(content: Text('Form submitted')));
                  }
                },
                child: Text('Submit'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
